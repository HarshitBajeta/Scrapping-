Data scraping using Beautiful Soup is a process of extracting specific data from a website by parsing the HTML or XML code of the website. Beautiful Soup is a Python library that provides a simple and effective way to parse HTML and XML documents. The procedure involves the following steps:

 1. Importing the Beautiful Soup library and the requests library (if necessary).
 
 2. Sending an HTTP request to the URL of the webpage to retrieve the HTML content.
 
 3. Creating a Beautiful Soup object from the HTML content.
 
 4. Locating the HTML elements that contain the desired data using Beautiful Soup's search functions.
 
 5. Extracting the data from the HTML elements and storing it in a desired format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database).
 
By following these steps, data scraping using Beautiful Soup can be a powerful tool for extracting valuable information from websites.

I used above procedure for collecting the data from single page after then I automate this procedure for rest of the pages.
